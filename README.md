# Helix-EXon-finder

**H**elix-**EX**on-finder, or **HEX** finder, is a a command-line tool that uses uses a deep learning model trained on physicochemical profiles derived from DNA sequences for genomic feature detection.

+ The models and algorithms at the heart of this tool were developed, trained, and evaluated for my final project in the Brandeis GPS Bioinformatics program for an independence research course (RBIF 120).

+ This work was inspired by and based on work [published by Mishra et al. in 2021](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkab098), as well as follow-up work published by [Sharma et al. in 2025](https://doi.org/10.1039/D4MO00241E). 

+ The source code, environment configuration file, and documentation will be here soon (early 2026)!

+ I hope to keep improving this tool past the performance demonstrated in the pre-print/manuscript, e.g., via an HMM-based post processing model coupled with the physicocehmical classification one.
  
+ Please contact **jhgmbioinfo@gmail.com** with any questions about the pre-print or source code.
